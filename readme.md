# Kalyani - Encoder & Decoder Tool

**Kalyani** is a simple yet powerful web-based tool designed for encoding and decoding various formats such as Base64, Base32, Base58, and URL encoding. This tool is especially useful for cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers who need to encode and decode payloads for web application security testing, including tasks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) payload encoding and decoding.
 
## Why is Kalyani Useful?

Kalyani serves as an essential utility in the field of cybersecurity, especially for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and web application security experts. It allows you to quickly encode or decode text in multiple formats, which can be critical for testing security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks, URL manipulations, and other web-based exploits.

The ability to easily switch between encoding formats allows security researchers to test and manipulate data in a way that bypasses security filters, making it an indispensable tool for security assessments.

## When to Use Kalyani?

- **Web Application Security Testing**: When performing penetration testing on websites or web applications, you often need to encode or decode payloads to bypass security filters (like XSS filters) or manipulate URLs.
- **Bug Bounty Hunting**: If you're participating in bug bounty programs, Kalyani can assist in encoding payloads in various formats, helping you identify vulnerabilities related to user input, session data, or other areas.
- **Security Research**: For researchers exploring new attack vectors or testing vulnerabilities, the ability to encode and decode in different formats is crucial for experimenting with various encoding schemes and payloads.
- **Educational Purposes**: For students and beginners in cybersecurity, understanding how different encoding schemes work and how to use them in practical scenarios is essential. Kalyani provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for learning and experimenting with encodings.
